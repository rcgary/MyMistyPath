Welcome to Misty Path ðŸŒ¿, where I share my thoughts and works.

I'm Mistyâ€¦

**I'm a design learner** ðŸŽ¨ who believes good design should be both functional and beautiful. Although this might sound like a clichÃ©, I understand the philosophy in my own way. To me, it's about seamlessly integrating the function within the structure so that the purpose of the design is always clear and intuitive. It's also about creating beautiful works while acknowledging that beauty can be subjective and everyone has their unique perspective.

**I'm a deep thinker** ðŸ’­, I'm always contemplating the world around me. My thoughts move ten times faster than my actions, constantly waving beneath the surface but not always showing. When it comes to feasibility, there might already be a completed vision in my head, which encourages me to enjoy the entire process. I plan everything down to the smallest detail, as it makes me feel safe.

**I'm a quiet observer** ðŸ‘€, but don't be fooled by my calm demeanour - the most minor things can spark a fire inside me. Whether it's a good song popping up randomly in my playlist, my cat coming to cuddle with me in the middle of the night, a bottle of wine chosen carelessly but turning out to be delicious, or a rainbow appearing in the sky when I least expect it, I find joy in life's unexpected moments.

So join me on this journey through design, passion, and everything in between. Together, let's create something beautiful and embrace all the surprises life has in store.
